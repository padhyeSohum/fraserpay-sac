FraserPay is a school payments and initiative management platform for students, booth operators, and SAC administrators. It supports account access, QR-based interactions, booth sales, transaction tracking, fund management, and dashboard views for different user roles.

## How It Works

FraserPay is a Vite + React application with route-based flows for each user type:

- Students sign in, view their dashboard, access a personal QR code, manage settings, and track recent activity.
- Booth members join or manage booths, sell products, review transactions, and update booth settings.
- SAC users use the admin dashboard to manage users, booths, funds, points, transactions, and leaderboard data.
- Shared pages like the leaderboard, booth requests, and transaction summaries tie the workflows together.
- Authentication and user state are handled through the app context layer, while transaction and booth data are managed through dedicated services and contexts.
- Firebase is used for backend services, depending on the feature area.

## Project Structure

- `src/pages/Student` - student-facing dashboard, QR code, add funds, and settings screens
- `src/pages/Booth` - booth onboarding, selling, transactions, dashboard, and settings
- `src/pages/SAC` - SAC admin dashboard and management dialogs
- `src/contexts` - auth and transaction state, operations, and hooks
- `src/components` - shared UI components
- `src/integrations` - Firebase client setup
